# Social Media and Mental Health Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between social media usage and mental health. By analyzing survey data, we aim to understand how the amount of time spent on social media correlates with various mental health symptoms. The data includes 7 variables and responses to 12 Likert scale-based questions, which measure the frequency or intensity of different mental health aspects.

## Data Description

The dataset contains the following components:

- Variables: 7 variables related to the demographic and social media usage of individuals.
- Likert Scale Questions: 12 questions designed to measure the frequency or intensity of mental health symptoms. Responses range from 1 (low frequency/intensity) to 5 (high frequency/intensity).

## Objective

The main objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between social media usage and mental health. Specifically, we aim to verify if increased hours spent on social media are associated with higher levels of negative mental health symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and stress.

## Key Findings

**Correlation Analysis**: Our analysis consistently shows that the more hours an individual spends on social media, the more likely they are to experience negative mental health symptoms.

**Heatmap Visualization**: A heatmap of the correlation matrix highlights the strong relationship between social media usage and mental health indicators.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into how social media usage impacts mental health. The findings suggest a significant correlation between higher social media usage and increased negative mental health symptoms. These insights can inform further research and interventions aimed at promoting mental well-being in the digital age.
